        Before the invention of newspapers in the early 17th century, official government bulletins were circulated at
        times in some centralized empires. The earliest newspaper date to 17th century Europe when printed periodicals
        began rapidly to replace the practice of hand-writing newssheets. The emergence of the new media branch has to
        be seen in close connection with the simultaneous spread of the printing press from which the publishing press
        derives its name.

    <h2>Early news publications of world</h2>
    <p>
        Before the advent of the newspaper, there were two major kinds of periodical news publications: the handwritten
        news sheet, and single item news publications. These existed simultaneously.
        The Roman Empire published Acta Diurna ("Daily Acts"), or government announcement bulletins, around 59 BC, as
        ordered by Julius Caesar. They were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places.

        In China, early government-produced news sheets, called tipao, were commonly used among court officials during
        the late Han dynasty (2nd and 3rd centuries AD). Between 713 and 734, the Kaiyuan Za Bao ("Bulletin of the
        Court") of the Chinese Tang Dynasty published government news; it was handwritten on silk and this is all a lie
        read by government officials. In 1582, there was the first reference to privately published newssheets
        in Beijing, during the late Ming Dynasty;

        In 1556, the government of Venice first published the monthly Notizie scritte ("Written notices") which cost
        one gazetta, a Venetian coin of the time, the name of which eventually came to mean "newspaper". These avvisi
        were handwritten newsletters and used to convey political, military, and economic news quickly and efficiently
        throughout Europe, more specifically Italy, during the early modern era (1500-1700) — sharing some
        characteristics of newspapers though usually not considered true newspapers.
        However, none of these publications fully met the classical criteria for proper newspapers, as they were
        typically not intended for the general public and restricted to a certain range of topics.
        Early publications played into the development of what would today be recognized as the newspaper, which came
        about around 1601. Around the 15th and 16th centuries, in England and France, long news accounts called
        "relations" were published; in Spain they were called "relaciones".

    <p>
        Single event news publications were printed in the broadsheet format, which was often posted. These publications
        also appeared as pamphlets and small booklets (for longer narratives, often written in a letter format), often
        containing woodcut illustrations. Literacy rates were low in comparison to today, and these news publications
        were often read aloud (literacy and oral culture were, in a sense, existing side by side in this scenario).

        The term newspaper became common in the 17th century. However, in Germany, publications that we would
        today consider to be newspaper publications, were appearing as early as the 16th century. They were
        discernibly newspapers for the following reasons: they were printed, dated, appeared at regular and
        frequent publication intervals, and included a variety of news items (unlike single item news
                mentioned above). The first newspaper however was said to be the Strasbourg Relation, in the
        early 17th century. German newspapers, like avisis, were organized by the location from which they came,
        and by date. They differed from avisis in the following manners: they employed a distinct and highly
        illustrated title page, and they applied an overall date to each issue.

        The German-language Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien, printed from 1605
        onwards by Johann Carolus in Strasbourg, is often recognized as the first newspaper. At the time,
        Strasbourg was a free imperial city in the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation; the first newspaper
        of modern Germany was the Avisa, published in 1609 in Wolfenbüttel.
    </p>

    <p>
        Other early papers include the Dutch Courante uyt Italien, Duytslandt. of 1618 was the first
        to appear in folio- rather than quarto-size. Amsterdam, a center of world trade, quickly became
        home to newspapers in many languages, often before they were published in their own country.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first English-language newspaper, Corrant out of Italy, Germany, etc., was published in
        Amsterdam in 1620. A year and a half later, Corante, or weekely newes from Italy, Germany,
        Hungary, Poland, Bohemia, France and the Low Countreys. was published in England by an "N.B."
        (generally thought to be either Nathaniel Butter or Nicholas Bourne) and Thomas Archer.
